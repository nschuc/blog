I'm a software developer from Toronto. I'm interested in machine learning algorithms for document reading and comprehension. I'm currently fun-employed working on personal projects: machine reading models in TensorFlow, an arcade-style shooter in OpenGL/C++, and a frontend for [Keras](https://keras.io/) in React.
