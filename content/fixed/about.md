I'm a software developer from Toronto. I'm interested in machine learning algorithms for document reading and comprehension. I'm currently fun-employed working on personal projects: [machine reading models](https://github.com/nschuc/alternating-reader-tf) in TensorFlow, an [arcade-style game](https://github.com/nschuc/FlockingWars) in OpenGL/C++, and a [frontend for Keras](https://github.com/nschuc/keras-ui) in React.
