## Alternating Neural Attention Reader

This a blog post about machine reading models. I have implemented a modern deep neural attentive reader architecture in TensorFlow and this is a run-down of that project.

We'll probably need to do some math. Let's see if it works {{< tex "\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} 2^{-n} = 1" >}}. This should be inline.

{{< tex display="\int \frac{1}{x} dx = \ln |x|" >}}
